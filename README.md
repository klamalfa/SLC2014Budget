# SLC 2014 Budget
### A budget project for Salt Lake City

A project to display the SLC 2014 budget in an interactive Sankey chart
* A Sankey diagram looks like several rivers flowing together
* It would be nice if it could be made interactive through AWS or Shiny or something
* I think there are a few folks at the city who would appreciate the detail


I'm doing this to help my wife understand the city budget a little better.
